Notes:
- All of the text is assigned to boxes
    - The adjustment of the boxes reshapes the text
    - Panel labels have to be manually aligned to the box when change using the “align and distribute” functionality
    - The text in the main boxes wraps around the central circle
    - For information about wrapping and how to adjust it see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEQBlj0-wN8
- There are canvas guides everywhere
    - Enable or disable them by clicking on the ruler at the top of the canvas
    - For optimal use enable “advanced snapping” (triangle top right) and untick all options except for “Guide Lines”
